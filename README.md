# NHL Stats Database

## Description
The domain of our application is centered around the game day stats for the National Hockey
League (NHL). We will be focusing our scope on aspects of the league that a casual fan playing
fantasy hockey would be interested in, like team records and player stats. Fantasy hockey,
where fans draft their own team of NHL players and compete against each other based on their
real life performance, has recently exploded in popularity. In the NHL, there are approximately
23 active players on 32 different teams across the league playing 82 games per season. That’s
an overwhelming amount of information to know, and we want to make it easier for fans to
find out what’s important, regardless of their familiarity with fantasy hockey.
